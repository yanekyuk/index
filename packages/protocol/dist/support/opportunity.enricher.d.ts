 * overlap, return original data unchanged.
 *
 * Phase 1 — Intent check (free, no API call):
 *   Shared intent IDs mean the same declared user goal drove both opportunities.
 *   This is rare because the IntentReconciler already deduplicates intents per-user
 *   upstream, but when it fires it is definitive.
 *
 * Phase 2 — Batched embedding similarity (one API call for all remaining):
 *   For opportunities without shared intents, embed all reasoning texts in a single
 *   batch call and compare cosine similarity. Cross-user intent comparison (e.g.
 *   Alice's "find ML co-founder" vs Bob's "join ML startup") is implicitly handled
 *   here since reasoning text synthesizes both users' intents.
